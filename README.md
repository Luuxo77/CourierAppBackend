# Courier App Backend
Courier App Backend is the server-side part of the Courier App project, designed to make it easy to request courier services from different companies. This backend is built using ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, and PostgreSQL.

Users can create delivery inquiries by providing details like package dimensions, weight, delivery dates, and addresses. After submitting an inquiry, the system collects offers from different courier companies. Users can review these offers and choose the best courier company to deliver their package. They can also check the status of their package and receive email notifications about important updates.

Office workers can manage these inquiries by accepting or rejecting delivery requests. They handle the necessary documents like agreements and receipts and communicate with users about their request status.

Couriers can update the status of packages in the system. They can mark packages as received, delivered, or undeliverable, and provide reasons for any issues. This feature helps keep users and office workers informed about the current status of each package.
